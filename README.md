# The Conlang Dictionary Generator

This project will provide a means and template for more easily generating elegant Dictionaries in PDF using LaTeX for setting and Python for scripting.  The end goal of this project is to have end users provide files containing dictionary entries, formats for a given entry, Introductions, covers, and other sections that might seem relevant for use.  Once all the content has been provided, the end goal is simply that the user will call `make` and the pdf will be generated.

## Dictionary Sections

The dictionary comprises multiple sections beyond the words that will be enumerated and described.  Currently slated sections for inclusion in this project are as follows:

- Cover
- Contents
- Preface
- Abbreviations
- Pronunciation
- Dictionary
- Biographical Names
- Geographical Names

It is worthwhile to note that a given section need not be mandatory.  They may be removed as one sees fit.
